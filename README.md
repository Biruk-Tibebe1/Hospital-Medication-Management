# Medication Time Manager Proposal

## Problem

Nurses in hospitals and parents at home face challenges in managing complex medication schedules for children, risking missed or incorrect doses.

## Solution

A fullstack web application with a professional, hospital-grade interface to streamline medication management. Key features include:

- Adding and managing patient profiles with medication details (name, medication, dose times).
- Displaying a daily schedule dashboard with upcoming doses and status indicators.
- Marking doses as administered with a history log.
- Real-time in-app notifications for upcoming doses.

The app will feature a clean, intuitive UI with a hospital-inspired design (white/blue palette, clear typography, icons) to ensure usability and professionalism at first glance.

## Technologies

- **Front-End**: React with Tailwind CSS for responsive styling, Heroicons for icons.
- **Back-End**: Node.js with Express.js for a RESTful API.
- **Database**: MongoDB Community Server with Mongoose for local data management.
